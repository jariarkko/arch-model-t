# Potential Changes in RFC 7258 {#changes7258}

Other additional guidelines may be necessary also in {{RFC7258}}, the RFC that
specifies how IETF work should take into account pervasive monitoring, such as
the one performed as a part of broad, indiscriminate surveillance activity.

An initial, draft suggestion for starting point of those changes could be
adding the following paragraph after the 2nd paragraph in Section 2:

NEW:

> PM attacks include those cases where information collected by a
> legitimate protocol participant is misused for PM purposes. The
> attacks also include those cases where a protocol or network
> architecture results in centralized data storage or control functions
> relating to many users, raising the risk of said misuse.
