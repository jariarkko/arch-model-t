# Potential Changes in BCP 188/RFC 7258 {#changes7258}

Additional guidelines may be necessary also in BCP 188/RFC
7258{{RFC7258}}, which specifies how IETF work should take into account
pervasive monitoring.

An initial, draft suggestion for starting point of those changes could be
adding the following paragraph after the 2nd paragraph in Section 2:

NEW:

> PM attacks include those cases where information collected by a
> legitimate protocol participant is misused for PM purposes. The
> attacks also include those cases where a protocol or network
> architecture results in centralized data storage or control functions
> relating to many users, raising the risk of said misuse.
