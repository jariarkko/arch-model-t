Communications security has been at the center of many security improvements in
the Internet. The goal has been to ensure that communications are protected
against outside observers and attackers.

RFC 7258 is the IETF guidance on taking into account pervasive
monitoring threats in Internet technology development work.  This memo
suggests additions to RFC 7258 to cater for the evolving threats.
For instance, it may be necessary to also worry about information
collected by a legitimate protocol participant being misused
for pervasive monitoring purposes.
