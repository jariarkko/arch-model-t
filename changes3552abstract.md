Communications security has been at the center of many security improvements in
the Internet. The goal has been to ensure that communications are protected
against outside observers and attackers.

This memo suggests additions to the RFC 3552 threat model to cater for the evolving security and
privacy issues seen on the Internet today. For instance, it is often also necessary to protect against
endpoints that are compromised, malicious, or whose interests simply do not
align with the interests of users. While such protection is difficult,
there are some measures that can be taken and we argue that investigation
of these issues is warranted.
