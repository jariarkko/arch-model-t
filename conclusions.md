There are few hard rules in dealing with the evolving threats discussed in this document. However, we believe that Internet technology developers need to be aware of the issues beyond communications security, and consider them in design. At the IETF it would be beneficial to include some of these considerations in the usual systematic security analysis of technologies under development.

In particular, when the IETF develops infrastructure technology for the Internet (such as routing or naming systems), considering the impacts of data generated by those technologies is important. Minimising data collection from users, minimising the parties who get exposed to user data, and protecting data that is relayed or stored in systems should be a priority.

A key focus area at the IETF has been the security of transport protocols, and how transport layer security can be best used to provide the right security for various applications. However, more work is needed in equivalently broadly deployed tools for minimising or obfuscating information provided by users to other entities, and the use of end-to-end security through entities that are involved in the protocol exchange but who do not need to know everything that is being passed through them.
