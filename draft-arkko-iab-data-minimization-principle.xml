<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction">

<t>Communications security has been at the center of many security
improvements on the Internet. The goal has been to ensure that
communications are protected against outside observers and
attackers.</t>

<t>This has been exemplified in many aspects of IETF efforts, in the
threat models <xref target="RFC3552"/>, concerns about surveillance <xref target="RFC7258"/>,
IAB statements <xref target="Confidentiality"/>, and the introduction of encryption
in many protocols <xref target="RFC9000"/>, <xref target="RFC7858"/>, <xref target="RFC8484"/>. This has been
very successful. Advances in protecting most of our communications
with strong cryptographic has resulted in much improved security. Work on
these advances continues to be a key part of IETF’s security effort.</t>

<t>This document recommends that further action is needed, however. For
instance, the possibility that endpoints are compromised, malicious,
or have interests that do not align with the interests of users. Given
the advances in communication seceurity, adversaries have had to
increase their pressure against new avenues of attack. New adversaries
and risks have also arisen, e.g., due to increasing amount of
information stored in various Internet services.</t>

<t>While such protection is difficult, there are some measures that can
be taken. This document focuses on the specific question of data
passed to various parties – including the primary protocol
participants. What information is given to any other party should
depend on the role of that party. And the possibility of a compromised
entity sharing the information beyond the users’ expectations should be
kept in mind.</t>

<t>Careful control of information is also useful for technology
evolution. For instance, allowing a party to unnecessarily collect or
receive information may lead to a similar effect as described in
<xref target="RFC8546"/> for protocols: regardless of initial expectations, over
time unnecessary information will get used, leading to, for instance,
ossification.  Systems end up depend on having access to exactly the
same information as they had access to previously. This makes it hard
to change what information is provided or how it is provided.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="rec" title="Recommendations">

<t>The Principle of Least Privilege <xref target="PoLP"/> is applicable:</t>

<figure><artwork><![CDATA[
"Every program and every user of the system should operate 
 using the least set of privileges necessary to complete the
 job."
]]></artwork></figure>

<t>In this context, it is recommended that the protocol participants
minimize the information they share. I.e., they should provide only
the information to each other that is necessary for the function that
is expected to be performed by the other party.</t>

<t>This recommendation is of course very similar to the current approach
to communications security. As with communication security, we try to
avoid providing too much information as it may be misused or leak
through attacks. The same principle applies not just to routers and
potential attackers on path, but also many other services in the
Internet, including servers that provide some function.</t>

<t>Of course, participants may provide more information to each after
careful consideration, e.g., information provided in exchange of
some benefit, or to parties that are trusted by the participant.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="disc" title="Discussion">

<t>Information sharing may relate to different types of protocol exchanges:</t>

<t><list style="symbols">
  <t>The interaction of an endpoint with the network, e.g., information
they provide in any network attachment process or the wire images of
the packets sent via the network.</t>
  <t>The interaction of an endpoint with intermediaries such as group
messaging servers or NAT traversal relays.</t>
  <t>The interaction of an endpoint with a service, such as a website,
social networking function, or a telemetry collection point.</t>
  <t>End-to-end interactions between users, represented by applications
running on their computers.</t>
</list></t>

<t>Information sharing need not be explicitly carried information, e.g., a
data item in a message sent to a protocol participant. Indirectly
inferred information can also end up being shared, such as message arrival times or
patterns in the traffic flow. Information may also be obtained from
fingerprinting the protocol participants, in an effort to identify
unique endpoints or users.</t>

<t>Information may also be combined from multiple sources, e.g., websites
and social media systems collaborating to identify visiting users
<xref target="WP2021"/>.</t>

<section anchor="dealing-with-compromise" title="Dealing with compromise">

<t>Even with careful exposure of information, compromises may occur.  It
is important to build defenses to protect information, even when some
component in a system becomes compromised. This may involve designs
where no single party has all information such as with Oblivious DNS
<xref target="I-D.annee-dprive-oblivious-dns"/>, <xref target="I-D.pauly-dprive-oblivious-doh"/>
or HTTP <xref target="I-D.ietf-ohai-ohttp"/>, cryptographic designs where a service
such as with the recent IETF PPM effort <xref target="I-D.ietf-ppm-dap"/>, service
side encryption of data at rest, confidential computing, and other
mechanisms.</t>

<t>Protocols can ensure that forward secrecy is provided, so
that the damage resulting from a compromise of keying material has
limited impact.</t>

<t>On the client side, the client may trust that another party handles
information appropriately, but take steps to ensure or verify that
this is the case. For instance, as discussed above, the
client can encrypt a message only to the actual final recipient, even
if the server holds the message before it is delivered.</t>

<t>A corollary of the recommendation is that information should not be
disclosed, stored, or routed in cleartext through services that do not
need to have that information for the function they
perform.</t>

<t>For instance, a transport connection between two components of a
system is not an end-to-end connection even if it encompasses all the
protocol layers up to the application layer. It is not end-to-end, if
the information or control function it carries extends beyond
those components. For instance, just because an e-mail server can read
the contents of an e-mail message do not make it a legitimate
recipient of the e-mail.</t>

<t>The general topic of ensuring that protocol mechanisms stays evolvable
and workable is covered in <xref target="I-D.iab-use-it-or-lose-it"/>. But the
associated methods for reducing fingerprinting possibilities probably
deserve further study <xref target="Fingerprinting"/> <xref target="AmIUnique"/>. <xref target="I-D.wood-pearg-website-fingerprinting"/> discusses
one aspect of this.</t>

</section>
<section anchor="related" title="Related work">

<t>Hardie <xref target="RFC8558"/> discusses path signals, i.e., messages to or from
on-path elements to endpoints. In the past, path signals were often
implicit, e.g., network nodes interpreting in a particular way
transport protocol headers originally intended for end-to-end
consumption.  The document recommends a principle that implicit
signals should be avoided and that explicit signals be used instead,
and only when the signal’s originator intends that it be used by the
network elements on the path.</t>

<t>Arkko, Kuhlewind, Pauly, and Hardie
<xref target="I-D.iab-path-signals-collaboration"/> discuss the same topic, and
extend the RFC 8558 principles with recommendations to ensure minimum
set of parties, minimum information, and consent.</t>

<t>Thomson <xref target="I-D.thomson-tmi"/> discusses the role intermediaries in the
Internet architecture, at different layers of the stack. For instance,
a router is an intermediary, some parts of DNS infrastructure can be
intermediaries, messaging gateways are intermediaries. Thomson
discusses when intermediaries are or are not an appropriate tool, and
presents a number of principles relating to the use of intermediaries,
e.g., deliberate selection of protocol participants or limiting the
capabilities or information exposure related to the intermediaries.</t>

<t>Trammel and Kühlewind <xref target="RFC8546"/> discuss the concept of a “wire
image” of a protocol.  This is an abstraction of the information
available to an on-path non-participant in a networking protocol. It
relates to the topic of non-participants interpreting information that
is available to them in the “wire image” (or associated timing and
other indirect information). The issues are largely the same even for
participants. Even proper protocol participants may start to use
information available to them, regardless of whether it was intended
to that participant or simply relayed through them.</t>

<abstract><t>This document discusses the nature of signals seen by on-path elements examining transport protocols, contrasting implicit and explicit signals.  For example, TCP's state machine uses a series of well-known messages that are exchanged in the clear.  Because these are visible to network elements on the path between the two nodes setting up the transport connection, they are often used as signals by those network elements.  In transports that do not exchange these messages in the clear, on-path network elements lack those signals. Often, the removal of those signals is intended by those moving the messages to confidential channels.  Where the endpoints desire that network elements along the path receive these signals, this document recommends explicit signals be used.</t></abstract>

	 <t>   Communications security has been at the center of many security
   improvements in the Internet.  The goal has been to ensure that

   This memo suggests that the existing RFC 3552 threat model, while
   important and still valid, is no longer alone sufficient to cater for

   For instance, it is often also necessary to protect against endpoints
   that are compromised, malicious, or whose interests simply do not
   align with the interests of users.  While such protection is
   difficult, there are some measures that can be taken and we argue
   that investigation of these issues is warranted.

   It is particularly important to ensure that as we continue to develop

   privacy issues, are properly understood.

	 <t>   The IETF is well on its way to protecting connection metadata with
   protocols such as DNS-over-TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS, and work-in-
   progress towards encrypting the TLS SNI.  However, more work is
   needed to protect traffic metadata, especially in the context of web
   traffic.  In this document, we survey Website Fingerprinting attacks,
   which are a class of attacks that use machine learning techniques to
   attack web privacy, and highlight metadata leaks used by said
   attacks.  We also survey proposed mitigations for such leakage and
   discuss their applicability to IETF protocols such as TLS, QUIC, and
   HTTP.  We endeavor to show that Website Fingerprinting attacks are a
   serious problem that affect all Internet users, and we pose open
   problems and directions for future research in this area.

      <abstract>
	 <t>This document describes a protocol that allows clients to hide their IP addresses from DNS resolvers via proxying encrypted DNS over HTTPS (DoH) messages. This improves privacy of DNS operations by not allowing any one server entity to be aware of both the client IP address and the content of DNS queries and answers.

 This experimental protocol has been developed outside the IETF and is published here to guide implementation, ensure interoperability among implementations, and enable wide-scale experimentation.

      <abstract>
	 <t>   There are many situations in which it is desirable to take
   measurements of data which people consider sensitive.  In these
   cases, the entity taking the measurement is usually not interested in
   people&#39;s individual responses but rather in aggregated data.
   Conventional methods require collecting individual responses and then
   aggregating them, thus representing a threat to user privacy and
   rendering many such measurements difficult and impractical.  This
   document describes a multi-party distributed aggregation protocol
   (DAP) for privacy preserving measurement (PPM) which can be used to
   collect aggregate data without revealing any individual user&#39;s data.

      <abstract>
	 <t>   Recognizing the privacy vulnerabilities associated with DNS queries,
   a number of standards have been developed and services deployed that
   that encrypt a user&#39;s DNS queries to the recursive resolver and thus
   obscure them from some network observers and from the user&#39;s Internet
   service provider.  However, these systems merely transfer trust to a
   third party.  We argue that no single party should be able to
   associate DNS queries with a client IP address that issues those
   queries.  To this end, this document specifies Oblivious DNS (ODNS),
   which introduces an additional layer of obfuscation between clients
   and their queries.  To accomplish this, ODNS uses its own
   authoritative namespace; the authoritative servers for the ODNS
   namespace act as recursive resolvers for the DNS queries that they
   receive, but they never see the IP addresses for the clients that
   initiated these queries.  The ODNS experimental protocol is
   compatible with existing DNS infrastructure.
