--- abstract

Communications security has been at the center of many security
improvements in the Internet. The goal has been to ensure that
communications are protected against outside observers and
attackers. This memo suggests that this is no longer alone sufficient
to cater for the security and privacy issues seen on the Internet
today. For instance, it is often also necessary to protect against
endpoints that are compromised, malicious, or whose interests simply
do not align with the interests of users. While such protection is
difficult, there are some measures that can be taken. It is
particularly important that new technology and new deployments
consider the role of data passed to various parties -- including the
primary protocol participants -- and balance the information given to them
in light of their roles.

# Introduction {#introduction}

Communications security has been at the center of many security
improvements in the Internet. The goal has been to ensure that
communications are protected against outside observers and
attackers. This memo suggests that this is no longer alone sufficient
to cater for the security and privacy issues seen on the Internet
today. For instance, it is often also necessary to protect against
endpoints that are compromised, malicious, or whose interests simply
do not align with the interests of users. While such protection is
difficult, there are some measures that can be taken. It is
particularly important that new technology and new deployments
consider the role of data passed to various parties -- including the
primary protocol participants -- and balance the information given to them
in light of their roles.
