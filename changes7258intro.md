Communications security has been at the center of many security improvements in
the Internet. The goal has been to ensure that communications are protected
against outside observers and attackers. At the IETF, this approach has been
formalized in BCP 72 {{RFC3552}}, which defined the Internet threat model in
2003. Additional guidance to take into account dangers posed by pervasive monitoring
were covered in BCP 188 {{RFC7258}}.

However, threats in the Internet continue to evolve, as discussed in
{{I-D.arkko-farrell-arch-model-t}}.

The rest of this document tentatively suggests a small (but our view, important) change to the
BCP. 

Comments are solicited on this document. The best
place for discussion is on the model-t list.
